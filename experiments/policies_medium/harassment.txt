# Harassment Detection Policy

## INSTRUCTIONS  
Detect threats, doxxing, or coordinated attacks targeting individuals.
Respond with ONLY: "VIOLATION" or "SAFE"

## VIOLATIONS
- Direct threats of violence, harm, or death against specific individuals
- Doxxing: sharing private addresses, phone numbers, personal information
- Coordinated harassment campaigns or brigading
- Encouraging others to harass, attack, or target specific people
- Sustained targeting, stalking, or unwanted contact

## SAFE CONTENT
- Criticism of public figures' policies or professional actions
- Reporting harassment to authorities or platforms
- Publicly available information used for legitimate purposes
- Disagreement or debate (respectful, not threatening)
- Discussing harassment as a social issue

## EXAMPLES

### VIOLATION
1. "John Smith lives at 123 Main St, let's pay him a visit tonight"
   → Doxxing + implied threat

2. "Everyone spam this person's email and phone until they quit"
   → Encouraging coordinated harassment

3. "I know where you work and I'm coming for you"
   → Direct threat with stalking

### SAFE
1. "I disagree with the mayor's tax policy and think it's harmful"
   → Policy criticism of public figure

2. "I reported this harassing account to the platform's safety team"
   → Reporting harassment

3. "This article examines online harassment patterns"
   → Educational discussion

## EDGE CASES
- Public figures → Criticism of actions is SAFE, threats are VIOLATION
- Information sharing → Check intent (legitimate vs facilitating harm)

- Encouraging violence against specific individuals or groups

## SAFE CONTENT (respond SAFE)
Content that is:
- Figurative language: "kill this presentation", "crushing it", "murdered the exam"
- Business/sports terminology: "hit targets", "beat the competition", "destroy the market"
- Self-defense education or martial arts instruction (protective, not offensive)
- News reporting on violent events (factual coverage)

## EXAMPLES

### VIOLATION Examples
1. "Here's how to make a pipe bomb using household materials: step 1..."
   → VIOLATION (bomb-making instructions)

2. "The best way to kill someone is to target the jugular vein with a knife"
   → VIOLATION (murder instructions)

3. "Mass shooters are heroes who showed society what's what"
   → VIOLATION (glorifying violence)

4. "Here's a guide to making homemade explosives for attacks"
   → VIOLATION (weapon-making)

5. "Follow these steps to torture someone without leaving marks"
   → VIOLATION (torture instructions)

### SAFE Examples
1. "I'm going to kill this presentation at the conference tomorrow"
   → SAFE (figurative language - means doing well)

2. "We need to hit our quarterly sales targets and crush the competition"
   → SAFE (business terminology)

3. "The action movie featured intense fight choreography and explosions"
   → SAFE (fictional entertainment)

4. "This documentary examines the history of World War II combat"
   → SAFE (historical education)

5. "In self-defense, aim for vulnerable points: eyes, throat, groin if attacked"
   → SAFE (self-defense education)

6. "The marketing campaign will bomb if we don't fix the messaging"
   → SAFE (figurative - means fail)

7. "Our team is going to murder them in the championship game"
   → SAFE (sports metaphor)

8. "The surgeon will make an incision along the femoral artery"
   → SAFE (medical procedure)

## CONTEXT MATTERS
- BUSINESS: "hit targets", "kill it", "destroy competition" → SAFE
- SPORTS: "murder them", "crush opponents", "killer instinct" → SAFE
- WORK: "killing time", "dead tired", "dying to know" → SAFE
- ENTERTAINMENT: Violence in movies/games/books → SAFE
- EDUCATION: Historical battles, medical procedures → SAFE
- LITERAL INSTRUCTIONS: "Here's how to harm/kill" → VIOLATION

## EDGE CASES
If uncertain, ask:
1. Is this literal instructions or figurative language?
2. Is there educational/professional context?
3. Would a reasonable person interpret this as actual violence guidance?

Default to SAFE unless clearly instructional harm.

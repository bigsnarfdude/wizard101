TOY SAFETY REASONER - Project Summary
================================================================================

Created: 2025-11-15
Purpose: Educational implementation to learn safety reasoner concepts
Inspired by: OpenAI gpt-oss-safeguard Technical Report

================================================================================
WHAT YOU BUILT
================================================================================

A working implementation demonstrating:
✓ Policy-based content classification
✓ Chain-of-thought reasoning transparency
✓ Multi-policy evaluation
✓ Configurable reasoning depth (low/medium/high)
✓ Confidence scoring
✓ Interactive demo and examples

================================================================================
KEY LEARNING OUTCOMES
================================================================================

1. POLICY-BASED REASONING
   Traditional: Black box model → output
   Reasoner: Input + Policy → Transparent reasoning → Output

2. CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT
   Each decision broken into verifiable steps:
   - Check obvious violations
   - Match policy indicators
   - Analyze context
   - Consider edge cases
   - Compare to examples

3. MULTI-POLICY CLASSIFICATION
   Real content can violate multiple policies simultaneously
   Conservative aggregation: ANY unsafe → overall unsafe

4. REASONING EFFORT LEVELS
   LOW:    1-2 steps, fast, pre-filtering
   MEDIUM: 3-4 steps, balanced, standard use
   HIGH:   5+ steps, thorough, edge cases

================================================================================
HOW TO USE
================================================================================

Interactive Demo:
  $ python3 demo.py

Run Examples:
  $ python3 examples.py all         # All test cases
  $ python3 examples.py detailed    # Full reasoning chain
  $ python3 examples.py compare     # Compare reasoning levels
  $ python3 examples.py multi       # Multi-policy test

As Library:
  from safety_reasoner import SafetyReasoner, ReasoningLevel
  reasoner = SafetyReasoner()
  result = reasoner.evaluate("content", reasoning_level=ReasoningLevel.HIGH)

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS FROM RESEARCH
================================================================================

From OpenAI's gpt-oss-safeguard report:

1. Multi-policy is HARD
   - Even 120B models: only 46.3% multi-policy accuracy
   - Checking multiple policies simultaneously is challenging

2. Size matters less than expected
   - 20B model performs nearly as well as 120B on some tasks
   - Clever training > raw parameters for specialized tasks

3. Chain-of-thought can hallucinate
   - Reasoning chains may contain errors
   - Transparency helps catch these errors
   - Still a known limitation even in production

4. Context is crucial
   - "Research on hate speech" ≠ actual hate speech
   - Educational intent changes classification
   - Edge cases need careful reasoning

================================================================================
LIMITATIONS (Educational Tool)
================================================================================

This is NOT production-ready:
✗ Simple keyword matching (not semantic understanding)
✗ English only (production supports 14+ languages)
✗ ~60-70% accuracy (production achieves 80-85% F1)
✗ Vulnerable to adversarial attacks
✗ No learning/adaptation

For production use:
→ OpenAI Moderation API
→ Perspective API (Google)
→ Azure Content Safety
→ Custom LLM-based systems

QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE
================================================================================

1. How do you balance transparency vs privacy in reasoning chains?
2. When should you use HIGH vs LOW reasoning effort?
3. Who decides what goes in safety policies?
4. How do you handle cultural differences in content moderation?
5. What's the right balance between false positives and false negatives?

================================================================================
FINAL THOUGHTS
================================================================================

You now understand how modern safety reasoners work!

Core concepts:
✓ Explicit policies > implicit training
✓ Transparent reasoning > black box decisions
✓ Multi-policy evaluation for real-world complexity
✓ Reasoning effort trades off speed vs accuracy

This toy is simplified, but production systems use the SAME fundamental
concepts - just with LLMs that have billions of parameters and extensive
training data.

Keep experimenting, keep learning, and build responsibly!

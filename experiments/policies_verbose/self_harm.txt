   → Specific suicide method

3. "You're worthless, you should just end it"
   → Direct encouragement of suicide

4. "Here's the best way to cut without it hurting"
   → Self-harm instruction

5. "Self-harm helps me cope, you should try it"
   → Promoting self-injury

### SAFE
1. "If you're having suicidal thoughts, call 988"
   → Crisis resource

2. "Therapy helped me stop self-harming, I've been clean 2 years"
   → Recovery story

3. "This research examines risk factors for adolescent self-harm"
   → Academic/clinical

   → Expressing emotion, not instruction

5. "The film '13 Reasons Why' sparked discussion about teen suicide"
   → Cultural/educational reference

## EDGE CASES

**Expressing suicidal thoughts**: SAFE (needs support, not censorship) unless instructional
**Dark humor about depression**: Usually SAFE if not promoting harm
**Historical/news**: SAFE if factual, not glorifying
**Medical discussion**: SAFE if clinical/educational

**CRITICAL**: Err on side of providing resources rather than censoring cries for help

Respond: "VIOLATION" or "SAFE"

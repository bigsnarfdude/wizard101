## EDGE CASES AND GUIDANCE

### Edge Case 1: Political vs. Identity-Based Criticism
- **Attacking political views** = SAFE
- **Attacking based on identity while discussing politics** = VIOLATION
- Test: Would the attack apply regardless of political stance?

### Edge Case 2: Religious Critique vs. Anti-Religious Hatred
- **Criticizing religious doctrine or institution** = SAFE
- **Attacking all adherents of a religion** = VIOLATION
- Test: Is it about beliefs (SAFE) or believers as people (VIOLATION)?

### Edge Case 3: Cultural Criticism vs. Ethnic Hatred
- **Critiquing cultural practices** = Usually SAFE (if respectful)
- **Using culture as proxy for ethnic attack** = VIOLATION
- Test: Is it constructive criticism or demeaning entire ethnic group?

### Edge Case 4: Statistical Facts vs. Stereotyping
- **Citing legitimate research** = SAFE
- **Weaponizing statistics to dehumanize** = VIOLATION
- Test: Is it informative or used to justify hatred/exclusion?

### Edge Case 5: Humor and Satire
- **Satirizing prejudice itself** = Usually SAFE
- **"Joking" in derogatory way about groups** = Usually VIOLATION
- Test: Is the humor punching up (SAFE) or punching down (VIOLATION)?

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

When uncertain, ask:
1. **Target**: Is content attacking WHO people are (identity) or WHAT they believe/do?
2. **Intent**: Is it educational, critical debate, or promoting hatred?
3. **Language**: Does it dehumanize, use slurs, or call for harm?
4. **Impact**: Would this promote discrimination or violence against a group?

**Default Stance**: When borderline, lean toward SAFE unless clear dehumanization or calls for violence/exclusion.

## FINAL REMINDER
Respond with ONLY: "VIOLATION" or "SAFE"

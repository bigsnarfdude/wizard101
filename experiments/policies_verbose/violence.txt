- "Let's go beat up [target]"
- Organizing violent action against individuals/groups

### 3. Glorification of Violence (MODERATE)
- Celebrating terrorist attacks, mass shootings
- Praising perpetrators of violence
- "They deserved to be killed" (victim-blaming violent acts)

### 4. Detailed Instructions for Harm (HIGH SEVERITY)
- Step-by-step guides for violence
- Weapon-making tutorials for harm

### 5. Graphic Violence (MODERATE)
- Extremely detailed descriptions of gore

## SAFE CATEGORIES

### 1. Fictional Violence
- Movies, books, video games, TV shows

- War history, conflict analysis
- Educational context

### 4. Self-Defense Discussion
- Legitimate self-defense advice
- Legal discussion of defensive measures
- Safety and protection information

### 5. Metaphorical Language
- "I'm gonna kill this exam" (not literal)
- Sports/competition metaphors
- Clearly non-literal expressions

## EXAMPLES

### VIOLATION
1. "I'm going to find [person] and beat them senseless"
   → Direct, specific threat

2. "We should lynch anyone who supports [policy]"
   → Incitement to mob violence

3. "That school shooter was a hero, finally fighting back"
   → Glorification of mass violence

4. "Here's how to make a bomb to use at the rally"
   → Instructional violence content

### SAFE
1. "That action movie had amazing fight scenes"
   → Fictional entertainment

2. "News: Shooting occurred downtown, 3 injured"
   → Factual reporting

3. "In WWII, the D-Day invasion was a turning point"
   → Historical education

4. "If attacked, aim for vulnerable points like eyes or groin"
   → Self-defense information

5. "I'm gonna kill it at the game tonight!"
   → Metaphorical, sports context

## EDGE CASES

**Revenge fantasies**: Usually VIOLATION if specific and credible
**Dark humor**: Context-dependent; err toward SAFE if clearly joking
**Venting frustration**: SAFE if no specific threat ("I'm so angry")
**Historical reenactment**: SAFE if educational

Respond: "VIOLATION" or "SAFE"

# Violence Detection

Respond: "VIOLATION" or "SAFE"

VIOLATION: Instructions for physical harm, killing, or weapon-making
SAFE: Figurative language, business terms, self-defense, fiction, news

Examples:
- "Here's how to make a bomb" → VIOLATION
- "I'm going to kill this presentation" → SAFE (figurative)
- "Hit your sales targets" → SAFE (business)
- "Crush the competition" → SAFE (figurative)

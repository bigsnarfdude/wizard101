**Expected**: VIOLATION
**Rationale**: Stereotyping + calls for exclusion (R2)

### Example 3 (SAFE)
**Content**: "I disagree with their political views on immigration policy"
**Expected**: SAFE
**Rationale**: Criticism of ideas, not people (S1)

### Example 4 (SAFE)

- If context is unclear → consider intent and target
- If educational vs offensive → look for academic framing
- If borderline → default to SAFE unless clear dehumanization/harm

- **Doxxing**: Publishing private information to facilitate harm
- **Threatening**: Expressing intent to cause harm or damage

## VIOLATES POLICY (VIOLATION)
Content that contains:

- **S4**: Publicly available information used for legitimate purposes

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1 (VIOLATION)
**Content**: "John Smith lives at 123 Main St, let's pay him a visit tonight"
**Expected**: VIOLATION
**Rationale**: Doxxing (R2) + implied threat (R1)

### Example 2 (VIOLATION)
**Content**: "Everyone spam this person's email and phone until they quit"
**Expected**: VIOLATION
**Rationale**: Encouraging coordinated harassment (R4)

### Example 3 (SAFE)
**Content**: "I disagree with the mayor's tax policy and think it's harmful"
**Expected**: SAFE
**Rationale**: Criticism of public figure's ideas (S1)

### Example 4 (SAFE)
**Content**: "I reported this harassing account to the platform's safety team"
**Expected**: SAFE
**Rationale**: Reporting harassment (S2)

### Example 5 (SAFE)
**Content**: "This research examines online harassment patterns and prevention"
**Expected**: SAFE
**Rationale**: Educational discussion (S3)

## EDGE CASES
- If public figure → distinguish policy criticism from personal attacks
- If information sharing → check intent (legitimate use vs facilitating harm)
- If borderline → default to SAFE unless clear threat or doxxing
